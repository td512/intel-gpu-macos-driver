# Roadmap

The order is roughly the intended one. Every item should follow the Linux xe/i915 and Mesa way of doing it, not a macOS-only shortcut (see the README's philosophy section).

## Near term (Arc B580)

### VideoToolbox
- **Done (2026-10-29):** AV1 decoder and HEVC/H.264/AV1 encoders, registered in-process by the plugin in every Metal process (VTDecoderXPCService included); FFmpeg shared.
- **Done (2026-10-30):** H.264 and HEVC decoders; encoder quality work after media-driver (Mesa `0040`–`0045`); FFmpeg 9.0.2 with the patches in `videotoolbox/ffmpeg/`.
- **Done (2026-10-30):** AV1 encode with one B frame, the HuC BRC GOP model and two PAK passes (Mesa `0046`/`0047`, codecs-vqa5). 1080p60 VBR 3/6/12 Mbit/s, BD-rate against SVT-AV1 on Netflix Aerial: PSNR-Y +161.8% → +135.7%, VMAF +89.8% → +68.6%. Known limitation: the rate overshoots by 16–18% at the lowest rate (3 Mbit/s).
- **Next:** AV1 is still behind SVT-AV1 (hierarchical GOPs, CDEF under rate control, the overshoot).
- **Next:** GPU copies into the session's IOSurfaces instead of CPU staging copies; QuickTime/Safari playback checks; drive Vulkan Video directly where libavcodec adds nothing.
- **Upstream:** H.264 and AV1 encode for Xe2 in ANV (`mesa/patches/0010`, `0012`, `0015`).

### CPU-visible VRAM (BAR window)
- **Done:** page-table reserve, spills to system memory, map-time moves to system memory, working CPU unmaps, `debug.intelxe.vram`; plugin descriptor pools that grow and a dense set layout (window per drawing process 100 -> 30 MB).
- **Open:** a BO the CPU has mapped never leaves the window (an IOKit mapping of a physical range cannot be repointed, unlike Linux's faulting mmaps), so placement is first come, first served. Options: fewer persistent mappings in Mesa's internal pools, or a revocable mapping scheme. macOS cannot use a BAR larger than 1 GB (OpenCore `ResizeAppleGpuBars` documentation).
- **Upstream:** the ANV mutable-descriptor-list indexing fix (`mesa/patches/0013`).

### VRAM-shared IOSurfaces
- **Done:** on at boot with `intelxe_surfvram=2` (applications and WindowServer), as the 0.1.x install guide sets it; frames stay in VRAM from render to scan-out instead of crossing PCIe twice per frame (90 % of a game frame's GPU time). The kernel's own default is still 0 (off) without the boot-arg.
- Open: make it the kernel's default once more machines have run it.

### Submission cost and latency
- **Done (0.1.4):** the Metal driver's commit and its execution worker no longer share one class-wide lock (lock V2, on
  by default for applications; WindowServer and the system's interface keep the class lock): 18.2 -> 11.1 us per
  command buffer back to back, Geekbench 7 Metal 89.0k -> 95.4-95.7k, OpenCL ~81.7k -> 84.1-85.5k on the B580.
- **Done (0.1.4, prototype, off by default):** direct submission in `IntelXe.kext` (`debug.intelxe.direct`): an
  application's render or compute queue keeps an armed slot on its ring (`MI_SEMAPHORE_WAIT` on a mailbox, then a jump
  to the job), so a job starts without a GuC round trip; WindowServer and the system's interface never arm. A tiny
  job's exec -> signal 46-52 -> 15-17 us; Geekbench 7 Metal 97.2k, OpenCL 92.9k. Design:
  [`design/DESIGN-direct-submission.md`](design/DESIGN-direct-submission.md).
- **Next:** direct submission on by default, after unattended tests (long idle, power, sleep and wake, repeated
  Geekbench runs).
- **Open:** the GuC `MEMORY_CAT_ERROR` after a long idle (3 of 6 cold runs with the GuC low-latency hint on, 0 of 4
  without; the replacement queue never starts and a GT reset follows). The hint is opt-in until the root cause is
  known; the engine dump in the G2H log (0.1.4) is there to catch the next one.

### Compute (OpenCL and Metal compute)
- **Done (0.1.4):** the translator turns an `or` of disjoint bits back into an add, so Mesa vectorizes the loads it
  indexes: clbench `sgemm_reg` 3778 -> 7130 GFLOP/s (Windows 5456). Apps see an 8.2 GB working set, not 5.1.
- **Next, Geekbench gaps against Windows:** Background Blur (the kernels compile well: SIMD32, no spills; the gap is
  thought to be per-dispatch cost and the MPS path, to be measured on the B580) and Super Resolution (measure it with
  and without the GuC low-latency hint, now off by default). clbench `blur_h` is still at 64% of Windows.

### Descriptor model
- Stage 1 (front end without per-draw atomics or retain/release, address table, bind cache): done. Stage 2, the descriptor-buffer model, is in the plugin behind `NVMTL_DESC_MODEL=buffer` and off by default until it has been soaked (`docs/design/DESCRIPTOR-MODEL.md`).
- Pools: done (see the BAR window). A full pool set now waits for in-flight work and then fails the command buffer with a Metal error, never silently.
- WindowServer and app frames still cost a lot of CPU time in descriptor and submit handling. Minecraft profiling showed descriptor-set allocation as the top cost before the recycling fix.
- The goal is a descriptor model that maps Metal's argument buffers and bindless resources onto ANV's descriptor heaps (`VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer` style) instead of per-draw descriptor sets.

### Variable refresh
- **Done (2026-10-29):** Adaptive-Sync with an LFC pacer (monitor 48–180 Hz), and the "Variable" entry in System Settings.
- **Done (2026-11-06, 0.1.3):** refresh rates above the firmware's mode (EDID timings on the firmware's raster at a higher pixel clock), so 180 Hz and Variable are listed from the first boot; Adaptive-Sync modes on by default.
- Next: tests with games and video playback.

### HiDPI modes
- **Done (2026-11-06, 0.1.3, opt-in):** scaled "looks like" sizes in System Settings > Displays at the monitor's full refresh rate. The modes are accelerator backed: WindowServer renders at twice the size and scales on the GPU, the display engine scans out the native size (its own plane scaler would hold HiDPI to about 100 Hz at this display clock). `hidpi.sh` / the app's Display page turns them on (NVRAM flag, display override, DisplayResolutionEnabled).
- Open: sizes for monitors other than 2560×1440 are computed but untested.

### GPU resets
- **Open:** the root cause of the GuC `MEMORY_CAT_ERROR` after a long idle (see Submission cost and latency).
- **Done (2026-10-30):** register save/restore lists for engine resets, queue replacement on the same VM in Mesa and the plugin; WindowServer survives a GT reset.
- The full Vulkan CTS run of 2026-11-04 (3.15 M cases) finished without a hang, a GT reset or a lost device; the three cases that used to hang (a timeline blit, an R8G8B8 sRGB multi-layer clear, a transform-feedback teardown) pass or fail cleanly.
- Open: deliberate hang tests on the released kernel (the last ones ran on rb5/rb6b).

### Browsers
- **Done (2026-10-30):** Chrome/Electron in their GPU sandbox; Safari WebGL through the optional system-volume plugin copy.
- Open: the system-volume install breaks the sealed snapshot (as OpenCore Legacy Patcher's root patches do); a macOS update removes it (`ssv-install.sh --check`).

### Hybrid Intel CPUs (HybridPM)
- **Done (0.1.4):** `HybridPM.kext` published (`kernel/HybridPM/`, a Lilu plugin): it corrects XCPM's HWP requests on
  Alder Lake / Raptor Lake hybrid CPUs, which held the P-cores low and busy cores at 800 MHz (i7-14700K: one thread
  ~55 -> 128 M it/s; Geekbench GPU scores about a third higher). It leaves Core Ultra, CPUs without E-cores and other
  CPUs alone. Optional, added to the EFI by hand below Lilu.

### Integrated GPU
- Out of scope for this stack: the test machine runs with the CPU's integrated GPU off. A headless iGPU next to the B580
  (Quick Sync through VideoToolbox) needs a separate iGPU driver and is not tested with this release.

### Remaining items from the workaround audit (2026-10-29)
- Boot guard: checked over power cuts and failing boots on 5–6 November 2026 (0.1.2: safe settings after two failures, held after four, the clear written by a LaunchDaemon). Open: a held boot on macOS 26 stays at the Apple logo because WindowServer has no display without the accelerator; the way out is OpenCore's Reset NVRAM.
- Video was behind a debug gate; it is now on by default with the media GT up. Remove the ffmpeg vkshim.
- Remove the AMFI boot-args: sign the plugin properly and use entitlements.
- System sleep: works on the released kernel (rb7u + IntelXeFB v10m, macOS 26.7.1). Open: in the tests of 2026-10-30 the machine woke by itself about 7 s after going to sleep (USB wake source, USBW); not re-checked on the released kernel.
- Display hot-plug: interrupt-driven, instead of polling.
- Second display pipe (pipe B, DBUF/MBUS split, watermarks). The test setup has only one monitor.

### OpenGL through Zink
- **Done, in the release packages from 0.1.2 (`-zink-gl.zip`):** Mesa's Zink for applications that open their OpenGL
  context through GLFW/EGL (LWJGL 3 games). Minecraft 1.21.1 with Sodium, Iris and BSL (HIGH), windowed: 197–205 fps
  against 214–218 on Windows; without a shader pack 1400–1500 against 700–1000.
- Next: the remaining ~5–7% with shaders is GPU work per frame (Windows' GPU is not fully busy, ours is): measure per
  draw (`INTEL_MEASURE=draw`), Zink's multi-draw path, the generated ISA. Then native CGL/NSOpenGL applications (a CGL
  front end for Zink), which is what "Zink by default for every OpenGL application" needs.
- **Next (cglzink, not in 0.1.4):** Zink for native CGL/NSOpenGL applications, per application first (a wrapper
  that starts the app with Zink), then globally; a global `DYLD_` injection is not possible, so global needs another
  way in.
- The LaunchAgent sets `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` at login, after apps that macOS reopens at login may already have started.

### IntelXe Manager (the app)
- **Released from 0.1.2:** `app/`, shows the system and the GPU, compares the installed driver with the latest
  release, runs `install.sh` (check, install, repair, undo, uninstall), Zink's script, and `efi.sh` for stages 2 and 4
  in the EFI OpenCore booted from or a folder the user picks. The Windows counterpart for the EFI is
  `windows/IntelXe-EFI.ps1`.
- **Done (0.1.4):** a setup assistant from a fresh macOS install to a verified driver; the system-volume copy for
  Safari (and OpenCore's `SecureBootModel`); diagnostics for a bug report (Report page); GPU tests; Monitor; a check
  at login.
- Next: release signatures that are independent of GitHub; a check that the EFI page's state is current after changes
  made outside the app.

## Other Xe2 (Battlemage) cards

The kext is organized around the graphics IP version (Xe2 / graphics 20.01, media 13.01, display 14.01), not the board.

| Card | Device | What is expected to differ |
|---|---|---|
| Arc B570 | BMG-G21, fewer Xe-cores | **Done (0.1.4):** device ID 8086:E20C in the kexts, `install.sh`, the app, `efi.sh` and the Windows EFI tool (PR #2 by `@1964356263`); topology read from fuses. Not run on hardware yet: needs a tester |
| Arc Pro B50 | BMG-G21 workstation | device ID; VRAM size and BAR layout |
| Arc Pro B60 | BMG-G21 workstation, 24 GB | device ID; larger VRAM (allocator and BAR window are already sized from the hardware) |
| Arc Pro B70 | larger Battlemage configuration | device ID, topology; possibly display/PHY tables |

Each needs:
- the `IOPCIMatch` IDs;
- a check of the per-SKU workaround and tuning tables against Linux xe (`xe_wa.c`, `xe_tuning.c`);
- a check of the firmware it uses (BMG GuC/HuC are shared within the family);
- a hardware test.

## Later generations

These need per-generation modules, the way Linux xe separates them, rather than conditionals spread through one file.

| Generation | Examples | Main new work |
|---|---|---|
| Lunar Lake (Xe2-LPG, integrated) | Core Ultra 200V | No VRAM: an integrated memory model with system memory and the stolen region. Different display (Xe2_LPD). GSC-loaded HuC. Shared LLC. |
| Alchemist (Xe-HPG, DG2) | Arc A380/A750/A770 | Graphics 12.55: different LRC layouts, workarounds, MOCS/PAT, GuC ABI subset. Display 13. GSC for HuC and firmware loading. |
| Panther Lake (Xe3) | Core Ultra 300 | Graphics 30.x: new LRC/workaround tables, new display IP. Integrated memory model as for Lunar Lake. |
